# Firetable Actions


This repo provides a firebase cloud functions project with a callable cloud function wrapper that handles role permission and the required fields validation for firetable action columns

You can fork this repo then modify the example [here](https://github.com/shamsmosowi/FiretableActions/blob/master/functions/src/index.ts)

Deploy the ```/functions``` folder like any other firebase cloud functions project, once the cloud function is successfully deployed you can specify the name in the firetable column configuration
